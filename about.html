        <p>From a young age, I was classically trained in Dance, primarily Ballet and Modern. I had the privilege of being accepted into Laguardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, which was an incredibly unique experience. Being that it is one of the most prestigious specialized High Schools in NYC, all 2,800 of us traveled from near and wide to handle, at age 14, what most college students experience for the first time — balancing a full load of academics plus a Major, all while given the ultimate freedom to explore the “concrete jungle”. Let’s just say, I grew up fast.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As fate would have it, I continued to Major in dance through college and eventually perform professionally with a Modern Dance company called PKDC. I toured with them throughout the Northeast Region for about three years, which was invigorating and exciting, but also trying.</p>

        <p>Knowing that a dance career is fairly short-lived, I started researching what options I had outside of performing, which is what led me to the fitness industry which would be my next career path… or so I thought. I began as a certified Pure Barre instructor, and within 3 years worked my way up to managing two of the business’s Brooklyn locations. After two and a half years of management experience, I realized just how unhappy I was.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I had lost the passion and fulfillment of working in a team environment and the stimulation of creative collaborations. That's when I learned about UX/UI Design & Research.</p>

        <p>It all started with a simple phone call when a friend of mine who is a software engineer, asked me for advice on an app idea he had. He said he thought of me because (like most millennials I know) I spent a lot of time on my phone and apparently made a few comments in the past which made him think I might be a good resource. Well, the conversation took off, and about an hour later, I had learned about a totally new and exciting field of work that I had never even heard of before! I could already start to feel my creative juices flowing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Fairly soon after, I took the plunge and began to make my transition out of my General Manager role to pursue my new dream. I still do, and always hope to, teach Pure Barre classes part-time simply because I love it. However, I’m beyond eager to be diving into a new career that evokes creativity and promotes a balanced lifestyle, but this time from a virtual standpoint.</p>
