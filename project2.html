        <h2>Process</h2>
        <p>The idea for Reisa’s Pieces came about a few years ago when I was with my family on summer vacation. We were taking a boat to another island for the day, and I found myself wishing I could bring a dry change of clothes for after our water activities, an extra pair of shoes for dinner that evening, and a sweater since it's always colder at night. But who wants to carry a heavy bag, large enough to fit everything you need all... day... long.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The process I followed while creating Reisa's Pieces was a mixture of personal experience and extensive research. I began by conducting a detailed study of user research, competitive analysis, user personas, and a journey map. I built upon that information by creating a strategy that consisted of user stories &amp; flows, wireframes, branding, high fidelity mockups, and user testing. After various iterations based on my users’ feedback, I created the final version you see here today!</p>

            <h2 class="CompetitiveAnalysisTitle">Competitive Analysis</h2>
            <p>I started out by studying various short-term storage facilities- The three companies I researched are LuggageHero, Stasher, and Nannybag which are all based in the UK but offer international services. What I found to be most interesting is that they ONLY offer storage through third-party companies, rather than using their own facilities. I also noticed that bicycle storage is widely sought but difficult to come by- even though Nannybag has a wider range of accommodations, it still has restrictions related to liability concerns of what they can and can’t store for customers. I quickly noticed that luggage storage for tourists is a fairly new concept, which is a plus- without a ton of competition already on the market it’s easier to stand out.</p>

        <h2>User Research</h2>
        <p>This led me to my next step, which was to conduct a survey. The cool part about this survey was that you could actually see the users' thought processes evolve as they progressed through the survey. At the beginning, when asked if they’d ever felt inconvenienced by carrying around all of their potential necessities throughout a busy day, only a little over 65% of people said yes. However, by the end of the survey, when the participants were presented with real-life situations and then presented with the same option of using short-term storage in those times of need, the number of people who said they would use this service jumped up to about 80%.</p>
